# Library-System
The program allows tracking of books and patron.

---

In this program, imagine that a Library organization wants to track how much money they could earn if they were a commercial organization that charged
late fees for overdue books. This information will then be used for local librarians to apply for funding from
other non-profit foundations or the government. Each book and patron will be modeled by classes with
relevant data and methods as outlined in the UML diagram and descriptions shown below. The Library class
will then have arrays of books and patrons along with methods that allow for books to be checked in,
checked out, and found in addition to determining fines.

Look at the following UML Diagram of this library system.
